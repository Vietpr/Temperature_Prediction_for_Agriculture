# Temperature Prediction for Agriculture using Machine Learning

# Introduction

The agricultural sector faces significant challenges due to the variability of weather conditions, impacting crop growth, water management, and overall farm planning. To address this challenge, accurate temperature forecasting tailored to agricultural requirements is crucial.

# Objective
This project focuses on developing temperature prediction models using machine learning algorithms to empower farmers in making informed decisions regarding planting timing, crop selection, and resource allocation.

#Methodology
Three algorithms - Linear Regression, SVR, and XGboost - are employed, with input variables selected based on their moderate to strong association with temperature.

#Significance
Accurate temperature forecasts play a fundamental role in optimizing resource management, minimizing risks, and promoting sustainable agricultural practices. This project aims to contribute towards addressing the current challenges facing the agricultural sector.
